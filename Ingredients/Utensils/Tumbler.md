A *tumbler glass* is a flat-floored glass comes in various shapes and  sizes, and can accommodate  pretty much anything from a simple juice to a sophisticated [[Cocktails|cocktail]]. Anything from a lowball glass, a [[Shot Glass|shot glass]], and a water glass falls under this category. If a drinks recipe calls for a tumbler glass, it is pretty much just calling for any glass it'll fit in.
