**Chicken** is the most common type of poultry used in cooking. It can be prepared in a vast amount of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying and boiling. As it is a whole animal, it is comprised of many parts, which are all prepared in their own ways.
The main parts of the chicken are:
- [[Chicken Breast|Chicken breast]]: white, relatively dry meat. It consists of two segments, the breast and the tenderloin. The latter is usually excluded from boneless chicken breasts.
- [[Chicken Leg|Chicken leg]]: dark meat, comprising two segments
	- [[Chicken Drumstick|Chicken drumstick]], the lower part of the leg
	- [[Chicken Thigh Fillet|Chicken thigh]], the upper part of the leg.
- [[Chicken Wing|Chicken wing]]: the wings of the chicken, often served as a light meal or a snack. 

It is of great importance to make sure that chicken is fully cooked before consuming. Raw chicken may contain salmonella or other foodborne pathogens.
Similarly, it should be noted that chicken bones are not fit for consumption by humans or animals, as the hollow bones will splinter easily. However, it is fine to simmer them with vegetables in order to make [[Chicken Stock|chicken stock]].
