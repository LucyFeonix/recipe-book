Onions are the rare food that can be sweet, savory, pungent and aromatic all at the same time. They are a luxury item that elevate a dish from sustenance to good. It doesn't contribute much in the way of nutrition, but it adds flavour and texture to soups, salsas, curries and sauces. They can also act as a topper or garnish. There are four ways to use an onion, and seven kinds of onion.
## Kinds of Onion
- **[[Yellow Onion]]**
Yellow onions are the everyday onion, and are assumed to be what is used if nothing else is specified. It's got brown skin and white flesh, and smells strongly.
-  **[[Sweet Onion]]**
Sweet onions are larger and slightly flatter than yellow onions, with less opaque skin. They're good for caramelizing, and are ideal for making [[Onion Rings|onion rings]]. 
-  **[[White Onion]]**
White onions have a papery white skin, and are milder and sweeter than yellow onions. They're good for serving raw, in sauces or salads.
-  **[[Red Onion]]**
Red onions are sweet and mild, which make them a good addition to salads, as well as anything that requires a splash of colour. They're also good on sandwiches and burgers.
-  **[[Shallots]]**
Shallots are smaller, brown-skinned onions with purple flesh. They're pungent and garlicky, and have an intense flavour. They're easily minced and are splendid for use in salad dressings and sauces; and are good for roasting.
- **[[Scallions|Green Onions]]**
Green onions aren't mature yet. The entire plant is usable, including the tall green shoots. They're great for garnish on pretty much anything, and can also add a bit of colour or crunch to a dish. 
-  **[[Leek]]**
Leeks are like overgrown scallions, and are great in soups and sauces. Baking te leeks mellows their flavour and softens them. They can also function as greens by themselves, for example, [[Leek à la Gratinée|leek à la gratinée]]. 
## Preparations
- **Sweating**
	Sweating an onion is to cook it over low heat until the onion becomes soft and clear without browning. This will soften the flavour and texture of the onion, and will increase its sweetness.
-  **Sautéing**
	Sautéing is a slightly more intense version of sweating, where it is cooked over high heat with a small amount of [[Oil]] until the onions are golden brown. They'll be softer than a freshly cut onion, but not as soft as a sweated onion. It'll have a rich, sweet flavour.
- **Caramelised**
	Caramelisation is a slow process that combines sweating and sauteing. To caramelise onions, you put them over medium-low heat, adding small amounts of water anytime the onion starts to look dry or begins to brown very quickly. This helps to dissolve sugars to prevent burning. When it begins to brown, lower the heat and stir. These onions provide deep, sweet flavour.
