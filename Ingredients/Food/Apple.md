*Apples* are a ubiquitous fruit with a crisp bite and juicy sweetness. By itself, it makes for a healthy and fiber-filled snack, but it is also well-used for cooking and baking. 
Generally, the smaller the apple is cut, the faster it will cook/bake - care should be taken to avoid overcooking it, as it will turn mushy. The taste and texture added to cooking by apples varies greatly through which species of apple is used.
In general, apples can combine well with spices like [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]], [[Nutmeg|nutmeg]], [[Cloves|cloves]] or [[Cardamom|cardamom]]. If going a more savoury route, you may wish to pair it with [[Sage|sage]] or [[Rosemary|rosemary]] instead.

- **Grilling** will cook an apple fast, and offers a sweet, slightly charred but sweet taste.
- **Saut√©ing** the apple makes for a quick, sweet treat, ideal for on top of [[Pancake|pancakes]], especially in combination with [[Cinnamon|cinnamon]] - or for pairing with [[Pork Tenderloin|pork tenderloin]].
