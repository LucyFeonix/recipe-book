These unusual looking [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] have a unique rich, smoky taste with a fruity aroma. They are often compared to [[Truffle|truffles]], making them an equally sophisticated choice for dishes. It is important to limit cooking time with these. They can also be used dried or powdered as an umami seasoning. These work well in #TypeOfFood/Risotto, #TypeOfFood/Sauce , and #TypeOfFood/Stew 

If these are freshly foraged, they should first be thoroughly cleaned. After brushing, give them a short dip in cool water, and pat them dry afterwards.
The mushrooms are hollow, and will cook quickly. Because of the hollowness, they will also wilt down easily to a fraction of its size in the pan.
When freshly harvested, they will also turn the rest of the food in the pan black - making it a pungent though delicious food safe dye.
It is recommended that these are used lightly, as they can be bitter if you use too many in a dish. The bitterness will easily concentrate in reduction-type sauces such as purees and soups.

Black trumpet mushrooms can be dried. They dry easily at 120-145F in a dehydrator. After this, they can well be stored in a mason jar. When used in cooking, it is recommended to rehydrate these dried mushrooms with warm liquid, stock, or alcohol.
