*Oyster mushrooms* are an edible type of [[Mushrooms|mushroom]] that is commonly found all over the world - except for in the Pacific Northwest. They belong to the genus *Pleurotus Ostreatus*, and are identifiable by their oyster-shaped caps and decurrent gills (attached to and directly running down the stem). They grow on largely dead material,  in a shelf-like formation with overlapping clusters. The cap is white to light brown, and it has a smooth top, with no warts or scales. Oyster mushrooms are mostly found in summer and fall, as well as winter in warmer areas.  

Oyster mushrooms are popular in Chinese and Japanese cuisines due to their delicate and complex flavour profile and tender texture. They cook quickly, making them ideal for #TypeOfFood/Stirfry , #TypeOfFood/Soup  and #TypeOfFood/Salad . By itself, the mushroom doesn't have a lot of flavour. It mostly shines when prepared with something else. When cooked, they are dense, and don't easily lose their texture.
