These are the slightly more mature *[[Button Mushrooms|agaricus bisporus]]*. Because of the longer growth, they have a more pronounced, earthy, nutty flavour and a more meaty texture. They are still very versatile, and can be used almost interchangeably with the regular button mushrooms. These are best used in #TypeOfFood/Risotto  or when roasting/sautéing something.

To clean the mushrooms, brush them off with a mushroom brush. Do not clean them in water - it will prevent the mushrooms from browning. Alternatively, a paper towel can be used.
Chestnut mushrooms are just about as versatile as button mushrooms. However, they benefit more from the browning process - it deepens the flavour, and makes them slightly more sweet. They are best browned in [[Butter|butter]], not in [[Oil|oil]].
- Chestnut mushrooms soak up flavours and liquids just as well as their younger cousins.
- These, too, pair well with [[Garlic|garlic]]. Due to the nutty flavour, it also pairs well with cream.
