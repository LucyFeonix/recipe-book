These are the slightly more mature *[[Button Mushrooms|agaricus bisporus]]*. Because of the longer growth, they have a more pronounced, earthy, nutty flavour and a more meaty texture. They are still very versatile, and can be used almost interchangeably with the regular button mushrooms. These are best used in #TypeOfFood/Risotto  or when roasting/sautéing something.
