These [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]], also known as _beech mushrooms_, are a popular gourmet mushroom in Asia. They belong to the *hypsizygus tessellatus* species, native to eastern Asia, but cultivated worldwide. The mushroom has small, round caps, and long, slender stems that grow from an interconnected base. They are noted to have a nutty flavour with buttery notes. Brown beech mushrooms are nuttier, while white beech mushrooms are sweeter - in this way, they are analogous to [[Button Mushrooms|agaricus bisporus]]. 

They are known to retain their texture when cooked, offering a slightly crunchy, firm bite. Care must be taken to not overcook them, as they will lose their texture. These are great in #TypeOfFood/Stirfry , #TypeOfFood/Noodles , and #TypeOfFood/Soup .
When cooking with Shimeji mushrooms, the first step is to trim away the base of the bundle, and then separating the stalks, so that they can cook evenly. They should be washed or brushed before use.
