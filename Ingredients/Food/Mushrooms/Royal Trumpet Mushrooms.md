These are the largest variety of [[Oyster Mushrooms|oyster mushrooms]]. They are noted for their thick, white stems, as well as their somewhat flat, golden brown caps. Their large size makes them a versatile pick - working well in pretty much any application. 
The king trumpet mushroom has a delicate, nutty flavour, as well as a firm, meaty texture. It is described as being similar to [[Scallop|scallops]], and can resemble these too, when cut crosswise. 
Due to the moisture content and solid stems, they are great for grilling, saut√©ing, or roasting.

To prepare these mushrooms, they should be brushed off or briefly rinsed off, and pat dry with a paper towel. The whole thing is edible, so the sky is the limit for these mushrooms when it comes to uses.
