The immature _agaricus bisporus_ is easily the most common [[Mushrooms|mushroom]] used in food. It is the 'default' mushroom - if nothing else is mentioned, this should be your go-to. While bland by itself, this mushroom is incredibly versatile and pairs well with almost all other ingredients. They are flavour sponges, and offer a satisfying, chewy texture. Best in #TypeOfFood/Sauce and #TypeOfFood/Sautée.

Because of their sheer versatility, it is not possible to describe all the ways these can be used here. There are, however, some tips:
- Button mushrooms soak up liquids incredibly well, and hold on to flavour well.
- They taste great when fried for a little too long - basting them well in [[Butter|butter]] or [[Oil|oil]] makes for a nice, golden, crispy exterior with the aforementioned flavour sponge.
- While it soaks up all other flavours well, it pairs especially well with [[Garlic|garlic]].
