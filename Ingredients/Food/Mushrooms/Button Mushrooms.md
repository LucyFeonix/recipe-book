The immature _agaricus bisporus_ is easily the most common [[Mushrooms|mushroom]] used in food. It is the 'default' mushroom - if nothing else is mentioned, this should be your go-to. While bland by itself, this mushroom is incredibly versatile and pairs well with almost all other ingredients. They are flavour sponges, and offer a satisfying, chewy texture. Best in #TypeOfFood/Sauce and #TypeOfFood/Sautée.
