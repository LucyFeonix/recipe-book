Morels are a seasonal delicacy found in the wild during late winter or early spring. These [[Mushrooms|mushrooms]] are prized for their rich, nutty flavour and unique, meaty texture. Their shape can range from oblong to bulbous, and their colour from blonde to grey. They can be distinguished by their exterior, which has a honeycomb-like resemblance. The inside of the mushroom is white and hollow. They are native to North America and Europe, where they are harvested in the wild. 
Because of their difficulty in cultivation; their short growing season; and their inability to keep fresh well, they are not often found in shops, and are usually handpicked in the wild.

They are very versatile and can be prepared in various ways, bringing an earthy, nutty taste to any #TypeOfFood/Risotto , #TypeOfFood/Stuffing , #TypeOfFood/Sauce.
To prepare morels, they should be quickly rinsed with water, and patted dry with a paper towel. After this, they should be sliced up and cooked in the desired way - making sure that all of the mushroom cooks (evenly), as raw morel can actually cause stomach cramps. In spite of this, care should be taken to not overcook the mushroom, as it will turn into a nasty, slimy mess. Don't forget - they are hollow, so "cooked through" may be quicker than expected.
Flavour-wise, morels pair great with [[Asparagus|asparagus]]. 

> [!warning] When going foraging for these mushrooms, you should take care to avoid false morels - these are usually a reddish-brown to yellow in colouration, with a cap that generally hangs to one side. Usually, these are also not hollow on the inside. Some species of false morel can be poisonous, so don't use them unless you're sure you're using actual morels!
