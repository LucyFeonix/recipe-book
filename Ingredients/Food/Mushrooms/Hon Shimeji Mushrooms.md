Brown beech mushrooms are nuttier, while white beech mushrooms are sweeter. They are known to retain their texture when cooked, offering a slightly crunchy, firm bite. Care must be taken to not overcook them, as they will lose their texture. These are great in #TypeOfFood/Stirfry , #TypeOfFood/Noodles , and #TypeOfFood/Soup
