Fully matured *[[Button Mushrooms|agaricus bisporus]]*. These have large, meaty cups and offer a more intense flavour. These tend to get slimy when cooked in any type of fat, so it is recommended to prepare these in a dry heat. When done well, these can offer a great meat substitute. They are ideal for [[Stuffed Portobello|stuffing]] or grilling due to their size.
