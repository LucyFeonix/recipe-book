Salt can have multiple functions in cooking food. It can act as a preservative, a texture enhancer, flavour enhancer, a binding agent, and even a colour enhancer.
## Function
- **Preservative**
	Salt can reduce the capacity of microbes to grow through the removal of moisture from food. This is either done through curing something (for example, meat) in salt, letting the salt draw all the moisture out of the food item. It is also possible to brine something, which is soaking food in heavily salted water, which preserves and flavours food. [[Pickle|pickling]] is a good example of this.
- **Texture Enhancement**
	Salt is used as a texture enhancer - mostly in baking and when working with meat. Salt affects the rate of yeast fermentation and formation of [[Gluten|gluten]], which makes it integral in forming the final texture of [[Bread|bread]]. It also affects the gelatinization of proteins, which is relevant in most [[Cheese|cheese]] production as well as processed meat. 
	Additionally, salt is sometimes used as a garnish to add a more crunchy texture to something like [[Steak|steak]].
- **Flavour Enhancement**
	Salt, of course, tastes salty, which is a highly sought-after flavour in and of itself. Additionally, in small amounts, it will intensify sweetness and counteract bitter flavours. Hence, it could be used to make more 'bitter' vegetables such as [[Brussels Sprouts|brussels sprouts]] or [[Broccoli|broccoli]] less intense.
	In small amounts, it will also mildly enhance any other existing flavours in the food.
-  **Binding**
	Aforementioned gelatinization of proteins can also help in binding more fatty substances together.
- **Colour**
	The presence of salt can promote and maintain colour in most types of meat, but is also responsible for the caramelisation of bread crust, promoting a more golden colour.

## Types
There are several types of salt. In most cases, it will not matter if you use table salt (or any other form of salt that you prefer), but sometimes, some salts work better than others.
- **Table salt**
	Most baking recipes will call for table salt. This is because it dissolves easily, strengthens gluten, and serves some function in controlling yeast growth. Table salt isn't ideal when seasoning food, however - it's been stripped of its flavour characteristics during the refining process.
-  **Kosher Salt / Sea Salt**
	Kosher salt and sea salt are largely similar, though kosher salt is more intense. As a rule of thumb, ***1 tablespoon of kosher salt equals 2 tablespoons of sea salt*.** These two are irregularly shaped, and are good for flavouring as well as texture.
-  **Finishing / Gourmet Salt**
	This kind of salt is usually too expensive for day-to-day cooking. It is best used as a garnish, and mostly add texture rather than flavour.. Included in this are **himalayan pink salt, fleur de sel, and sel gris.**
