*Black pepper* is a widely used seasoning that adds a mild kick of heat, that mostly serves to highlight other flavours. It goes very well with [[Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Thyme|thyme]], [[Garlic|garlic]] and [[Paprika|paprika]]. You can get it in multiple forms, which all have a slightly different effect on dishes.
## Variants
-  **Coarsely Ground**
	Coarsely ground black pepper delivers a mild kick of heat that highlights other flavours. It's at home on and in almost everything. It adds a savory spark to any recipe with [[Cheese|cheese]]. 
- **Pure Ground**
	Pure-ground black pepper is great for specific dishes, like [[Steak au Poivre|steak au poivre]]. It's great for adding a layer of heat to something like a curry, a rub or a marinade, without changing the texture. It'll also enhance the flavour of [[Chilli Pepper|chili pepper]]. 
-  **Whole Peppercorn**
	When added whole, whole peppercorns are good for flavouring long-simmered stocks and stews, or brines.
