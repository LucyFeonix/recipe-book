*Canola oil*, or *rapeseed oil*, is one of the oldest known [[Vegetable Oil|vegetable oils]]. It is derived from canola, a turnip variant. It is produced through slightly heating the seeds, and then crushing them. It is then refined through water precipitation, filtered to remove colour, and deodorised using steam distillation.
The remaining canola seeds are generally used as animal feed. As the oil ages, it can start smelling a little fishy.

The oil is used for human consumption, as well as a lubricant for machinery, as well as a former use in lighting. Rapeseed oil is generally used as the 'industrial' variant, while canola oil usually denotes the culinarily used variant. 
Since canola oil is highly refined, it has a high smoke point of about 400F. It has a mild flavour, allowing it to be used for a variety of culinary applications. It is relatively neutral, so it is generally well-used in seasoning pans, #TypeOfFood/Stirfry, or saut√©ing.
