*Oil* is a type of fats broadly used in all kitchens. They are generally derived from plants, animals, or fully synthetic compounds. There are many oils, each with different ‘specialties’ - some impart flavours, some are neutral, and some are best used to work maintenance on kitchen gear.
There are several factors to consider when choosing the best cooking oil. including how hot or how long you will be cooking the food and the smoke point of the oil. When heated, some oils break down and create unhealthy compounds that can be harmful. If oil begins to smoke, it is most likely starting to break down.
When no specific kind of oil is mentioned, something like vegetable oil or olive oil is probably fine.
