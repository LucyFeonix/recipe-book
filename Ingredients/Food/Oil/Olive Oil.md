*Olive oil* is the main cooking fat in Mediterranean cooking. It's best used when heated to shimmering rather than smoking. Alongside that, it is used in baking to make more tender, moist baked goods. 
## Kinds of Olive Oil
-  **Extra Virgin Olive Oil**
	This is the least processed form of olive oil. It's the most flavourful variant.
-  **Virgin Olive Oil**
	Virgin olive oil is slightly more processed but is overall lower quality than extra virgin olive oil. There is no particular use case for it.
-  **'Pure' Olive Oil**
	These bottles contain only olive oil, but they are a mix of more refined oil and virgin olive oil. It does the same, but lacks the taste that extra virgin olive oil is known for.
-  **Light Olive Oil**
	This oil is not lesser in calories, but it actually refers to the neutral - light - taste.
