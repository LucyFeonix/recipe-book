*Granulated sugar* is a type of highly refined [[Sugar|sugar]] that is broadly used in baking. It is highly refined sugar beets or sugar cane, devoid of any remaining [[Molasses|molasses]] or other impurities. 
The resulting crystalline sucrose is used as a sweetener in all types of foods, including baked goods, sweetened beverages, and savoury dishes. 
For baking, it is keeps the goods soft and moist, creating a tenderness within the dish. The crystals also cut into the batter, creating thousands of tiny air bubbles, making it a sort of leavening agent.
Along with this, it browns baked desserts (and other dishes) through caramelisation.

This type of sugar is generally run through a food processor that whiten and grind the crystals into a size roughly similar to [[Salt|table salt]].

> [!Warning] It is worth noting that not all white sugar is vegan, as some sugar companies use bone char to achieve whiter granules.
