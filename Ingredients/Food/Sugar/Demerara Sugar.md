*Demerara sugar* is a type of [[Sugar|sugar]] that is minimally processed. Like most other sugars, it is extracted from sugar cane, but does not undergo the full processing method. This means that it still contains traces of [[Molasses|molasses]], resulting in a light brown-coloured sugar that has a coarse texture and larger crystals.
The remaining molasses gives the sugar subtle caramel notes, that some describe as a toffee flavour. It tastes similar to [[Brown Sugar|brown sugar]].

Because of the larger crystals, demerara sugar takes logner to dissolve in recipes. It provides more flavour notes than plain [[Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]]. Cooking times should be long enough for the sugar to melt properly.
The crunchy texture of the sugar makes it perfect to sprinkle on top of cookies, quick breads, or other sweets.

Demerara can be used interchangeably with [[Turbinado Sugar|turbinado sugar]] and [[Muscovado Sugar|muscovado sugar]].
