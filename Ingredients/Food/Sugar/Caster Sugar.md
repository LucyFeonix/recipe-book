*Caster sugar* is a type of fine [[Granulated Sugar|granulated sugar]] that is common in the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, it is usually known as 'superfine sugar'. Its texture is somewhere between regular granulated sugar and [[Powdered Sugar|confectioner's sugar]]. This type of [[Sugar|sugar]] is available in two varieties: regular and golden.
Similar to [[Brown Sugar|brown sugar]], the golden variety of caster sugar retains a little bit of [[Molasses|molasses]] from the refining process, and has a warmer, more caramel-like flavour as a result.

Because of its finer texture, caster sugar dissolves and incorporates more quickly. As such, it is best used in applications such as light and airy desserts, or in tea. In essence, though, it can be used in the exact same ways as granulated sugar.
When using granulated sugar as a substitute for caster sugar, it can be done with a 1:1 ratio. Just make sure that whatever thing you're making has enough time to incorporate the larger granules.
