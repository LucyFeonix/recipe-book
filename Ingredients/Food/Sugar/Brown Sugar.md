*Brown sugar* is a [[Sugar|sugar]] product with a distinctive brown colour, due to the presence of [[Molasses|molasses]]. Traditionally, it is raw sugar that has been partially refined.
Nowadays, it is often produced by adding sugar cane molasses to completely refined [[White Sugar|white sugar]] crystals, in order to more carefully exercise control over the production process. 
There are multiple subvariants of brown sugar, such as [[Turbinado Sugar|turbinado sugar]] or [[Muscovado Sugar|muscovado sugar]]. 

This kind of sugar adds flavour to most desserts and baked goods. It can easily be substituted for [[Maple Syrup|maple syrup]], and vice versa.
It caramelises much more readily than refined sugar, which is useful to make glazes and gravies in a slightly easier fashion than with granulated sugar.
Brown sugar imparts more moisture than crystallised sugar - this should be taken into account when used in baking.
