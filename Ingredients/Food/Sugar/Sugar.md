Sugar is a sweet crystalline substance, with several uses in cooking and baking.
## Uses
- **Flavour**
	Sugar adds sweetness, and balances out other more acidic and bitter flavours.
- **Preservation**
	The crystals stop bacteria from growing and delay spoilage through maintaining and stabilising the water content of foods, prolonging shelf life.
- **Texture**
	In baking and in a lot of Asian dishes, sugar can provide some form of texture or enhance existing textures. In baking, this is through interaction with leavening agents, resulting in less cracks on the cookies, cakes and biscuits. Additionally, sugar can help dairy products taste more smooth.
- **Colour**
	Many sugars tend to turn brown when heated up, turning it to [[Caramel|caramel]]. This is sometimes used in glazing.
- Fermentation
	Through the use of [[Yeast|yeast]], sugars are converted into ethanol to make alcoholic beverages. In a similar vein, [[Yogurt|yogurt]], [[Vinegar|vinegar]] and [[Cheese|cheese]] are made through the fermentation of sugar.
## Types
### Solid
- **[[Granulated Sugar]]**
	This is the go-to sugar in baking and cooking. It is highly refined, and white in colour. It is practical for its ability to easily dissolve into a liquid or batter.
- **[[Brown Sugar]]**
	This is a mixture of granulated sugar and [[Molasses|molasses]], which ends up producing a slightly moist texture and a more caramel-y flavour.
- **[[Caster Sugar|Caster Sugar / Superfine sugar / Baker's Sugar]]**
	A slightly less common variant of sugar, this is ideal for baking, being finer than granulated sugar but less fine than powdered sugar. It melts very easily and quickly.
- **[[Powdered Sugar|Powdered Sugar / Confectioner's Sugar / Icing Sugar]]**
	This has a more powdery texture that smoothly mixes into frostings or drinks. It contains and anti-caking agent such as [[Corn Starch|cornstarch]] to prevent it from clumping.
- **[[Demerara Sugar]]**
	Demerara has large grains that create a more crunchy texture, which is ideal for topping baking goods. Its flavour is more toffee-like, so it is also good for sweetening hot beverages.
- **[[Turbinado Sugar]]**
	Partially refined, these are large crystals and golden-brown with a subtle caramel-ish flavour.
- **[[Muscovado Sugar]]**
	An unrefined cane sugar with molasses. It is deeply brown-coloured, and brings a moist texture and robust flavour to drinks and confections.
### Liquid
- **[[Molasses]]**
	Technically a byproduct of extracting sugarcane, molasses has a sweet, smoky flavour that lends itself well to cookies and barbecued meats.
- **[[Sorghum Syrup]]**
	This syrup has a thinner consistency than molasses and has a slightly sour taste. It is good for drizzling on top of cakes, biscuits or bread, and is good in marinades.
- **[[Maple Syrup]]**
	Maple syrup has a fluid yet viscous texture and a caramel flavour. It's great as a drizzle over pancake, a glaze, or on roast vegetables.
- **[[Honey]]**
	Also a syrup, it's a popular sugar product used in desserts such as baklava. It's very applicable to many things. It's also not considered vegan by all vegans.
