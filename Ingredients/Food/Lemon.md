Lemons are a citrus fruit that is iconic for its sour notes, but also has sweet notes. It's used for adding acids and zest to dishes. It can be used as a flavour enhancer, a garnish, or as a finishing touch.

## Uses
### Zest
Lemons can be zested. The taste of the zest is more concentrated than that of juice, and contains a hint of bitterness. This stuff can be obtained through use of a [[Microplane|microplane]]. If a recipe calls for both zest and juice, zest first.
Zest is useful for adding flavour to a recipe (mostly salads, dressings), especially things with more lemons in them. It can also be used as a garnish on things, if you want.
### Juice
Lemon juice goes well in most sauces, and might serve as an alternative for [[Vinegar|vinegar]] in such. It'll also act as a leavening agent in baking, if necessary, and as a flavour enhancer in soups, stews, and chilis. Of course, lemon juice is also usable in drinks, like [[Homemade Lemonade|lemonade]].
