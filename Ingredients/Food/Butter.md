*Butter* is a fat, traditionally made from cow [[Milk|milk]], and has a rich flavour and creamy texture. It also contains essential vitamins, carbohydrates, minerals, and some vitamin A.
Its melting point sits around 98F. 

There are three principal types of butter:
- [[Unsalted Butter|Unsalted butter]] is best used in cooking and baking. If unspecified, this is what will be used. It is used to add a bit of fat to a dish without throwing off the salt balance.
- [[Salted Butter|Salted butter]] is usually used as a condiment. It is served at the table to spread on bread, or to top a dish after it's already been cooked. For ease of use, this should be thawed for ~30 minutes before use. It *can* be used in cooking and baking, but it is important to adjust the salt for the recipe.
- [[Clarified Butter|Clarified butter]] is pure butterfat. No more milk solids or water are left. It is capable of withstanding higher temperatures without browning/charring like regular butter. It has fewer calories and is easy to digest when dealing with lactose intolerance.

In baking, the high fat content of butter makes it ideal. It has high plasticity, meaning it gives great lamination and puff. 
Using it, it should always be at room temperature. It will make it easier to incorporate into the mixtures, and will make the final product nice and fluffy. Melt the butter only if the recipe specifies it.
To create a more airy, flaky texture, cold butter should be used.

In cooking, butter is used to elevate the flavour in vegetables and proteins. It has one of the lowest smoke points compared to other fats, so it can stay in the pan longer and can act as a cooking agent, allowing it to easily develop a subtle caramelisation with a nutty and rich flavour.
> [!hint] To prevent the butter from burning off, baste the items only when they are almost done cooking. this way, the flavour is maximised.

Finally, butter can be used in grilling. Generally, clarified butter is used on a lower heat. The side that is not being grilled would be basted, in order to lock in the flavour before flipping the item.
