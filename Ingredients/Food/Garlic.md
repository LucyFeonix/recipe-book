Garlic is an ingredient that plays a central role in most Mediterranean and Asian cuisines. It comes in two units: **bulbs**, which consist of **cloves**. Generally, the smaller the bulb is, the stronger the flavour. It can be used in several ways.
It can be added first, which allows it to mellow out more, or used as one of the later ingredients, where it does not get a chance to brown - resulting in a fresh garlic punch to any dish.
## Cooking Garlic
-  **Caramelised Garlic**
	This is achieved when you cook garlic in hot oil and let it get slightly browned around the edges. It's got a chance of darkening too much, turning it bitter and unpleasant. For this reason, it is often combined with [[Ginger|ginger]] or [[Onion|onions]] first, which are better indicators of when something is going to burn. Caramelised garlic is most easily achieved through slow-roasting it in the oven, which does take a long time, and is usually done whole bulbs at a time. In this case, it becomes more sweet and caramelised. 
-  **Garlic Infusions**
	You can also add the garlic to hot oil in stir-fries or sautés, to infuse the dish with flavour. It will make the oil more fragrant and delicious.
-  **Sweated Garlic**
	This is when you cook the garlic to deepen and mellow the flavours without browning it - so on low heat.
- **Raw Garlic**
Garlic can also be eaten raw. This can take several forms, among which:
	- Minced garlic as a dip for your [[Bread|bread]] or [[Baozi|baozi]]
	- Fresh cloves of garlic grated on toasted bread as a garnish or as a punchy flavour.
-  **Sizzled Garlic**
You can also heat a small amount of oil, and pour this over aromatics such as garlic and [[Onion|onions]]. It adds a little bit of umami, and takes the raw edge off. 
## Cutting Garlic
-  **Crushed**
	Sometimes, it is best to just leave your garlic as is. In this, you crush it with the blade of your knife, to bring out the flavour, but do not cut it into any extra pieces.
 - **Chopped**
	For something like making a [[Broth|broth]] or braising something, roughly chopped garlic is enough. Simply run a knife through it once or twice, and voilà.
-  **Minced**
	Minced garlic is usually the way to go. It's used in anything where biting down on a bigger chunk of garlic is not desirable - particularly relevant when adding garlic later in the dish. You can do this with a knife, finely mincing the cloves, or with a garlic press.
- **Sliced**
	Sliced garlic are pleasing to the eye, and fairly easy to eat. Aside from that, it is easy to fry. 
 - **Pureed/Grated**
	Grated garlic is not very often useful as it is a lot of effort. Sometimes, however, it is useful in meat marinades where big chunks of garlic can burn in the oven or disrupt the texture of the meat. If you want a sauce with no chunky garlic texture, this would probably be the way to go.
