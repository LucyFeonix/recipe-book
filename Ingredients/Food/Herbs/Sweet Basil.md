*Basil* is an herb in the [[Mint|mint]] family that is essential in Italian and Mediterranean cooking. The most commonly used  version is sweet basil, and it is what is used when no further distinction is made.
The herb has a fragrant, sweet smell, and a peppery taste with a hint of mint. Larger leaves have a more pronounced flavour, and carry a slight spiciness. 
The other commonly used version is [[Thai Basil|thai basil]].

Sweet basil can be used both fresh and dried. When substituting fresh basil with dried basil, care should be taken that not too much is used. Generally, a ratio of 1:3 is used: one teaspoon of dried basil corresponds to one tablespoon of fresh basil.

While the herb has a very distinct flavour profile, most recipes that call for it can have some substitutes. 
- Dried basil can be substituted by [[Oregano|oregano]], [[Tarragon|tarragon]], [[Thyme|thyme]] or [[Savory|savory]]. 
- [[Spinach|Spinach]] or [[Celery|celery leaves]] can be used in place of fresh basil, if necessary.
> [!hint] It should be noted that these substitutions are often not the same, but are at the very least compatible with the dishes. This is primarily in Mediterranean cooking - any other dishes might not work.
