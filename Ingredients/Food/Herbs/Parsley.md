Parsley is a Mediterranean herb, and is widely used in the surrounding cuisines.
## Variations
- **Flat-leaf Parsley**
	This is the most popular form of the herb. It has a fresh, slightly bitter taste that makes it a splendid garnish. This is what is usually used in #Cuisine/European/Italian dishes. 
- **Curly-leaf Parsley**
	The curly-leaf parsley is a milder tasting variety of parsley. It's recognisable by its ruffled leaves and bright green colour. 
- **Hamburg Parsley (Root)**
	This one has larger leaves and thicker roots. The leaves of this plant are used almost solely ornamentally, while the roots are a great ingredient in #TypeOfFood/Stew and #TypeOfFood/Soup.
- **Japanese Parsley**
	Quite uncommon, this variant of parsley is more bitter-tasting, and is recognisable by thicker stems that can be eaten alone.
- **Dried Parsley**
	Dried parsley is recommended to be used throughout the cooking process, as the concentrated flavours need time to marinate and mellow before serving. It's a flavourful addition to any red sauce, [[Minced Meat|minced meat]] dish, or herb-laced bread dough.
## Preparation
There are several ways parsley can be used in cooking.
- **Garnish**
	The vibrant, leafy appearance, along with the taste that serves to emphasise other flavours, makes parsley an ideal garnish. It is commonly chopped and added at the end of cooking. Prolonged heat exposure causes the flavours of parsley to diminish, as well as causing it to lose the vibrant green colour.
- **Base**
	Parsley can be used as a base in several popular sauces, such as [[Homemade Pesto|pesto]] and [[Chimichurri|chimichurri]]. 
- **Bouquet Garni**
	The herb is also used in traditional French [[Bouquet Garni|bouquet garni]].
