*Thyme* is an herb popular in a number of countries and cuisines, but it is most prominently used in the Mediterranean kitchen. It is the main ingredient in [[Herbes de Provençe|herbes de provençe]] and [[Za'atar|za'atar]]. It has small leaves that grow in clusters on very thin, woody stems. 
The herb tastes mainly sharp and grassy, but has woody and floral notes.
Its dried variation is a lot more potent. Because of this, if fresh thyme is substituted by dried thyme, one should use a 1:3 ratio: one teaspoon of thyme to a tablespoon of fresh thyme.

While thyme has a distinctive flavour profile, [[Rosemary|rosemary]], [[Sage|sage]], [[Sweet Basil|basil]], [[Oregano|oregano]] or [[Marjoram|marjoram]] can often substitute the herb due to their compatibility with the recipes that thyme is usually found in.

To remove thyme leaves from the stem, slide your fingers down the stem while holding the top.
