*Tequila* is a strong Mexican liquor, based on the heart of the [[Agave|agave]] plant. These hearts are steamed, pressed, fermented, and then distilled. Authentic tequila has a fresh taste with notes of fruit, citrus, and agave. 
It can only be called tequila if the product is at least 51% agave juice.
There are three kinds of tequila:
- **Blanca** or **Silver** - a clear liquid with no ripping in any kind of vat.
- **Reposado** - ripened for three months to a year, usually in a small redwood vat.
- **Aejo** - aged for at least one year, usually in a vat that was previously used for [[Bourbon|bourbon]]. 

Tequila contains an ABV of 38%.

The popular way to consume tequila is by first licking some [[Salt|salt]] off your hands; drinking a shot of tequila, and then biting into a slice of [[Lemon|lemon]] or [[Lime|lime]]. It is also often used in [[Margarita|margaritas]], [[Tequila Sunrise|tequila sunrises]], [[Sangrita|sangritas]], [[Tequila Slammer|tequila slammers]], and [[Paloma|palomas]].
