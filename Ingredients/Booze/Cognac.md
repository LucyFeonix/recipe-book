*Cognac* is a French liquor made by distilling [[White Wine|white wine]]. It is a region-bound name, with specific races of grape associated with it. 
Generally speaking, Ugni Blanc is used. After the harvest, these grapes are pressed to a sour, cloudy wine. After this, it is twice distilled in a copper kettle. After the first distillation, it is a sort of [[Brandy|brandy]] that does not meet the ABV requirements of cognac.
After distillation, it is ripened in oaken vats from the Limousin or Tron√ßais region. It is aged for two years. After this, it is generally diluted with demineralise water. 

Age of the bottle is determined by the time the cognac spent in a vat. After it is bottled, it no longer ages.

Aged cognac has a soft, rounded taste, moreso the older it is.
