*Jenever* is a juniper-flavoured liquor from the BeNeLux regions. It is a precursor to [[Gin|gin]]. Originally, it was produced by distilling malt wine to 50% ABV, and then adding herbs to it to make it palatable. 
In some regions, it is produced with spelt.

There are two types of jenever, distinguished by distilling techniques and not age (despite the name). 
Old, *oude* jenever, is still made with grain alcohols. Young, *jonge* jenever uses alcohol based on [[Sugar|sugar]], primarily [[Molasses|molasses]]. 
While oude jenever refers to its distilling technique and not its actual age, it is not uncommon for the liquor to be age in oak casks, adding to the confusion.

Jonge jenever has a neutral taste, with a slightly aroma of juniper and malt wine.
Oude jenever has a smoother, more aromatic taste with malty flavours. It is occasionally aged in barrels, which adds to the flavou, resembling [[Whisky|whisky]] in some cases.

The young drink is generally served cold, or on the rocks. Older variants are to be served at room temperature.
There are multiple traditions involving jenever:
- A *Kopstoot*, or headbutt, is when jenever is drunk alongside a [[Beer|beer]] as a chaser.
- A *duikboot*, or submarine, is when the glass of jenever is dipped into the beer before drinking.
