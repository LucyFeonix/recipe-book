# Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 220°C with an oven rack in the middle position.
2. In a small bowl, combine the paprika, coriander, fennel, garlic powder, cumin, cayenne, 3/4 tsp [[Salt|salt]]. and 3/4 tsp [[Black Pepper|black pepper]] and stir to incorporate. Rub the pork tenderloin with 1 tbsp of olive oil, then rub the spice mixture all over the meat.
3. In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, warm 1 tbsp olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork, adjust the heat to medium, and cook until browned all over. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
4. Return the skillet to medium heat, add the remaining olive oil, and warm. Add the onion, bell peppers, and 1 tsp salt, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the skillet. Cook for about 8 minutes.
5. Add the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant. Return the pork to the skillet over the peppers, and roast the meat until the internal temperature reads 60°C (±15 minutes). Let the pork rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
6. Turn off the oven and return the skillet with its vegetables to the oven to keep warm. 
7. After 5 minutes of the pork resting, remove the skillet from the oven, and stir in the sherry and the parsley.  Cut the pork on the diagonal into 1 1/2 cm cuts, and arrange over the vegetables. Sprinkle lightly with salt, pepper, *and garnish with the remaining parsley*.
