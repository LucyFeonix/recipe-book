# Directions
1. Peel the potatoes, cut them into equal pieces, and cook them for ~20 minutes.
2. Cut the onions into half-rings, and finely slice the parsley, taking care to separate the leaves and the stems.
3. Heat half of the oil in a pan on medium heat and fry the bacon, onion, and parsley stems for 8 minutes. Lower the heat, and add the water and vinegar. Cook for 10 minutes.
> [!note] *If making this vegetarian, substitute the bacon bits for a vegetable stock cube.*
4. Halve the cabbage lengthwise, and then cut into ~2cm strips, widthwise.
5. Heat the rest of the oil in another pan on high heat, and fry the cabbage for ~7 minutes. After 5 minutes, add the five spices.
6. Drain the potatoes, add the milk and a little bit more olive oil. Mash into a puree. Add the cabbage.
7. Serve hot with the gravy made in step 3 and the parsley leaves from step 2 as garnish.
