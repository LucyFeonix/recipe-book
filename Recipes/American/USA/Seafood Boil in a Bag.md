# Directions
1.  Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water by about 3". Add 2 tsp salt, and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes, then add corn and garlic. Return to a boil, and cook until the potatoes are tender (~10 minutes). Drain and set aside.
2. Heat a deep skillet or saucepan over medium heat, add sausage, and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until sausage is browned on both sides. Remove from pan, and set aside.
3. Preheat the oven to 400F (200C), with an oven rack set in the lower third of the oven.
4. Add the onion to the skillet with the sausage drippings, and cook, stirring constantly, until the onion begins to soften. Stir in the wine, and scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pan; stir in water.
5. Add butter, hot sauce, lemon pepper, seafood and cajun seasonings, paprika, granulated garlic, and cayenne pepper to the skillet. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring constantly, until the butter is melted and everything is well combined. Remove from heat.
6. Place the corn and potatoes in the oven bag first. Add the mushrooms, eggs, crab legs, shrimp, and sausage; and pour over the butter mixture. Squeeze two lemon halves into the bag. Tie bag tightly at the top, allowing room for the bag to fill with steam. Carefully toss the contents of the bag to coat everything with sauce, and place bag in a large baking dish.
7. Bake in the preheated oven until the bag has filled with steam, the shrimp is opaque, and the crab is cooked through (about 30 minutes).
8. Carefully cut open the bag, squeeze the remaining lemon over the top, and enjoy.
