# Directions
1. In a small bowl, stir together the softened butter with the garlic. Spread the garlic butter onto the cut sides of the roll.
2. Toast the buns on a large skillet on medium heat, until golden brown. Set aside.
3. Add 1 tbsp oil to the pan, and saut√© diced onions until caramelised, then transfer to a bowl.
4. Increase to high heat, and add 1 tbsp oil. Spread the super thinly sliced steak in an even layer. Let brown for a couple of minutes, undisturbed. Then flip and season with salt and pepper. Stir in the caramelised onions.
5. Divide into even portions, and top each with 2 slices of cheese. Turn off the heat so the cheese will melt without overcooking the meat.
6. Spread a thin layer of mayonnaise on the toasted side of each roll. Working with one portion at a time, place a toasted bun over each portion, and use a spatula to scrape the cheesy beef into your bun as you flip it over.
