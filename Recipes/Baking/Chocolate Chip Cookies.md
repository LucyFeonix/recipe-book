# Directions
1. In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
2. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.
3. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula.
> [!warning] Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies.
4. Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for **at least** 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavour and deeper colour, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavour will be.
