# Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
## Topping
1. In a food processor, combine the flour, the sugars, cinnamon, and salt.
2. Scatter the walnuts on top and drizzle the melted butter over the mixture. Pulse until the mixture begins to resemble a wet, coarse sand. 
3. Scrape the mixture onto a plate, and refrigerate it for 20 minutes.
## Rest
1. In a food processor, pulse the walnuts with 1/4 cup of flour, until the walnuts are coarsely ground.
2. Pour the walnut mixture into a medium bowl, add the remaining flour, the espresso powder, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt, and whisk to combine.
3. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs until uniform. Add the sour cream, oil, and vanilla, and whisk vigorously to combine.
4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, and fold until no pockets of dry ingredients remain. Pour into a cake pan and smooth the top.
5. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the surface.
6. Bake until the top is lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the centre comes out clean, about 40-45 minutes, and rotate halfway through.
7. Let cool to room temperature before cutting and serving.
