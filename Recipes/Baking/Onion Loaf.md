# Directions
1. In a small skillet over medium heat, melt 1 tbsp of butter with the neutral oil. Add the onion and 3/4 tsp salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent and starting to soften. Add the leek and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened (~3 minutes). Set aside to cool.
2. Melt the remaining butter. Remove from the heat, and pour 1 tbsp of the melted butter into an oven dish. Coat the inside of the dish with a pastry brush. 
3. In a large bowl, combine both flours, the onion powder, baking powder, baking soda, and 1 1/4 tsp of salt.
4. In another large bowl, whisk together the eggs, the brown sugar, and buttermilk.
5. Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, and fold/stir until neatly incorporated. Add the reserved melted butter and the scallions, and continue to fold in until the ingredients form a lumpy dough.
6. Scrape the dough into the prepared dish, shape into an 8-inch log, and spread the onion mixture from step 1 on top, pressing in to adhere.
7. Bake the loaf until it is firm to the touch on the top, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. This should take about 45-50 minutes, and rotated halfway through. 
8. Let cool for about 10 minutes in the dish, then on a wire rack/cutting board to cool to room temperature.
