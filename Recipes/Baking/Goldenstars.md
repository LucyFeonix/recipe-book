# Directions
## Dough
1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, sugar, onion powder, baking powder, salt, and pepper. Whisk together.
2. In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, neutral oil, and water. Whisk until one homogenous mixture.
3. Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture and fold until incorporated into a dough.
4. Halve the dough onto a work surface and pat it into two six-inch disks. 
5. Cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for ±1 hour.

## Filling
1. Line a small plate with a paper towel and set aside.
2. In a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm the neutral oil. Add the sausage and cook, stirring and breaking it into small crumbles.
3. When it no longer appears raw, transfer the sausage to the prepared plate, leaving as much fat in the skillet as possible.
4. Add the potato, water, and a pinch of salt to the skillet on medium heat and cook, covered. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Cook until the potato starts to soften, ±10 minutes.
5. Add the butter and let melt, coating the pan. Then, add the leek, thyme, a pinch of salt, and cook until soft, ±2 minutes.
6. Slowly add the chicken broth, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom of the skillet. Cook until thickened, about 1 1/2 minutes.
> [!Hint] The texture will be quite thick, like mashed potatoes.
7. Add the reserved sausage and stir to incorporate. 
8. Remove the skillet from the heat and let the mixture cool for 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in the parsley.
## Pastries
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. On a generously floured work surface, roll out one of the dough discs into a roughly 12-inch circle no more than 1/4 inch thick. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, cut out four or five rounds. Reclaim the dough scraps.
3. Place about 1 1/2 tbsp of filling in the centre of each round. Lightly brush the edges of each round with the egg wash. Working with one at a time, form a triangle by folding three "sides" up and over the filling, leaving about 1 inch of filling uncovered. Pinch the edges together well (so they won't come apart as they bake). Place on a prepared baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there is no more dough remaining.
5. Bake the pastries until light golden and the filling is bubbling, ±25 minutes.
6. Let cool for ±5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and let cool.
