# Directions
1. On a floured work surface, roll out one of the pie crusts into an oval, 14x7". Cut out 7" circles, and work into a small bowl or pie plate. Cover in plastic wrap and place in the freezer for 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 350F.
3. Place the frozen dough-lined plates on a rimmed baking sheet, and line with aluminium foil and pie weights.
4. Bake the crusts until the edges are set and just beginning to turn golden (25-30 min) and remove the foil and weights. Bake for another 12 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
5. Place 2 cups of the mixed blackberries/blueberries in a medium bowl, and set aside.
6. In a food processor, puree the remaining blackberries/blueberries until smooth. Strain through a fine mesh strainer into a saucepan, scraping and pressing on the solids to extract as much puree  as possible. Add the solids to the saucepan also.
7. In a bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, the corn starch, and salt. Mix this into the berry puree.
8. Set the saucepan over medium heat and bhring to a strong simmer, stirring and scraping the pan bottom constantly. Cook until the mixture is thickened and pudding-like (~20 minutes). Remove from the heat, and add the lemon juice and vanilla.
9. Meanwhile, warm the apple jelly until runny. Drizzle over the reserved blackberries and blueberries, and toss gently to coat. Add the raspberries, and toss very gently to coat and mix with the other berries.
10. Divide the puree over the pie crusts, and add the glazed berries on top. Chill for 3 hours to a day before serving.
