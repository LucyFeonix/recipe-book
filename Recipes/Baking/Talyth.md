# Directions
1. In a food processor, combine the flour, cheese, onion powder, thyme, cornstarch, salt, pepper and cayenne, and process for about 15 seconds. Scatter the butter slices over the flour mixture and pulse to cut the butter into the flour until the mixture has the texture of wet sand.
2. With the motor running, add the milk through the feed tube and process until a dough just comes together.
> [!Warning] 
> Do not overprocess! It'll turn the sandwiches way too brittle.
3. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead, if necessary, a couple of times to bring it together. Divide the dough in half, and roll each half into a log measuring about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and 3 inches long.
4. Wrap each log with plastic and refrigerate until very firm, at least 2 hours, or up to 3 days.

5. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
6. Unwrap the dough logs and, using a serrated knife, cut into thirty 1/4 inch thick rounds, giving them a quarter turn between each cut to help preserve the cylindrical shape. Arrange the dough shapes on the prepared baking sheets about 1/2 inch apart. Place one slice of sausage onto each slice of dough, pressing to help it adhere.
7. Bake the talyth until lightly browned around the edges and on the bottom, Â±26 minutes, swapping and rotating the baking sheets halfway through. 
8. Remove the sheets from the oven and, working quickly, use the underside of a dinner fork to gently press the sausage slices again so they adhere to the dough.
9. Let cool to room temperature before serving.
