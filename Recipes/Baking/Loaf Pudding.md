# Directions
1. With a rack in the middle position, preheat the oven to 180°C.
2. Coat a loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray and set aside. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper, place a wire rack on top, set aside.
3. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, almond meal, baking powder, and salt; whisk to incorporate, and set aside.
4. In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl with a flexible spatula once or twice. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Add the vanilla and almond  extract, beat well, and scrape down again.
5. Add about 1/3  of the flour mixture, followed by 1/2 of the yogurt, mixing after each addition until just incorporated. Repeat.
6. Add the remaining flour mixture, and mix until the batter is smooth.
> [!warning] Be careful not to overmix.
7. Using a flexible spatula, scrape the batter into the loaf pan, smooth the top, and sprinkle the almonds down the centre. Bake the loaf until the top is browned, the edges begin to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick comes out clean (±45 minutes), rotating the pan halfway through. Let cool for about 8 minutes.
8. Carefully turn the loaf out onto the rack and set right-side up.
9. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine the sugar, water, and salt and bring to a steamy simmer, dissolving the sugar. Continue simmering until glossy bubbles develop and the liquid is slightly thickened. Let the syrup cool to room temperature, add the vanilla and almond extract, and swirl to incorporate.
> [!tip] Using regular [[Simple Syrup|simple syrup]] saves a little bit of time, as you do not have to combine the sugar, water and salt.
10. While the loaf is still hot, use a long skewer to poke deep holes on its bottom and sides, as well as along both sides of the almonds on top. Brush the syrup over the holes all over the loaf, allowing it to be absorbed. Return the loaf to the rack to cool to room temperature. Slice and serve.
