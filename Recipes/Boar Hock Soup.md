# Directions
1. Sprinkle the pork all over with [[Salt|salt]] and [[Pepper|pepper]]. 
2. In a large Dutch oven overmedium heat, warm the olive oil until shimmering. Add the pork in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until browned on the bottom (±4 min). Turn the pork and continue cooking for ±4 minutes longer. Cut into 3/4” pieces, discarding any large pieces of fat.
3. Return the Dutch oven to medium-high heat. Add the carrots, onions, bay leaves, thyme, fennel and some salt, and cook, stirring and scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve the caramelised bits, until the vegetables soften (±5 minutes). Adjust the heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, for another ±6 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen and dissolve the caramelised bits.
4. Adjust the heat to medium-high, add the garlic, and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 40 seconds. Add the chicken broth and reserved ook with its accumulated juices, and bring to a strong simmer. If foam forms on the surface, skim and discard it. Adjust the heat to low, cover, and let simmer for 40 minutes. 
5. Adjust the heat to medium-high and bring the soup to a strong simmer. Add the potatoes, leeks, most of the chestnuts, some salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]], and return to a simmer.
6. Adjust the heat to medium-low, replace the cover, and continue until the potato cubes and leeks begin to soften (±20 minutes)
7. Remove the soup from heat and let rest for about 30 minutes for the flavours to meld. Remove the bay leaves (if you can find them).
8. Transfer about 3/4 cup of the soup, including some potato cubes, to a blender. Add the remaining chestnuts, and  lend as smooth as possible. Scrape the puree into the pot, add the vinegar and parsley, and stir to incorporate. 
9. Serve, garnishing with the remaining parsley.
