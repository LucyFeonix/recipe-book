# Directions
1. In a colander or large strainer set over a medium bowl, toss the cabbage with 2 tsp salt. Let the cabbage rest until slightly wilted, at least 1 hour or up to 4 hours.
2. Rinse the cabbage well under very cold running water, drain thoroughly, and dry very well with a clean kitchen towel or paper towels. Scrape the cabbage into a large bowl and fluff it with your hands.
> [!note] 
> The cabbage can be covered and refrigerated for up to 3 days.
3. In a large bowl, combine the olives, vinegar, lemon zest, garlic, and 1/2 tsp salt, season with [[Black Pepper|pepper]]; and whisk to incorporate. 
4. While whisking vigorously, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream, to combine and emulsify into a dressing.
5. Add the cabbage, fennel bulb, scallions, and parsley to the bowl and toss to combine. Adjust the seasoning with additional salt and pepper, if necessary.
6. Sprinkle with fennel fronds before serving.
