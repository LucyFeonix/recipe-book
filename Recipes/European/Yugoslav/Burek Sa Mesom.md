# Directions
1. In a large skillet, saut√© the onion and minced meat over medium heat, until the meat is no longer pink and the onions are translucent. Drain in a colander.
2. Return the meat-onion mixture to skillet and add the parsley, [[Salt|salt]] and [[Black Pepper|black pepper]] to taste, and cook for 1 minute, mixing thoroughly. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
3. Lightly coat a 9x13" pan with cooking spray. Separate the phyllo dough into two piles of roughly 10-14 sheets each, and keep covered so they don't dry out.
4. Place 2 sheets in the prepared pan and brush lightly with oil, folding in any overhanging edges. Repeat until you have used one pile of dough.
5. Spread the cooled mince meat mixture evenly over the phyllo, pushing up to the edges. Cover the meat with the remaining dough, repeating step 4.
6. Brush the entire top lightly with oil. Using a serrated knife, cut the burek all the way to the bottom into 12 squares.
7. In a medium bowl, mix the eggs with the yogurt and soda water. Pour over the burek, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 2 hours.
8. Preheat the oven to 350F. Remove the plastic wrap, and bake for ~50 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool slightly before serving.
