# Directions
1. Using paper towels, pat the steaks dry and generously season with salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]] on both sides and along the edges. Let rest at room temperature for an hour
> [!note] Or refrigerate, loosely covered, for up to two days. Return to room temperature before continuing.
2. Set a cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 7 minutes. Adjust the heat to high, and add the oil, swirl to cover the bottom of the pan.
3. Add the steaks, and cook, flipping them every 30 seconds, until a pale golden crust begins to form on both sides: 3 to 4 minutes.
4. Adjust the heat to medium-high, slide the steaks to one side of the skillet, and add the butter to the other side, allowing it to melt. Then, add the garlic and the thyme.
5. Tilt the pan so that it pools the butter opposite the steaks. Use a spoon to baste the steaks in the butter/aromatics, focusing on less-crusted spots.
6. Continue until an instant-read meat thermometer reaches 120F (medium rare) or 130F (medium).
7. Transfer the steak to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, preferably loosely covered in aluminium foil. 
8. Slice before serving, and serve warm.
