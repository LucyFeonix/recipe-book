# Directions
1. Season both sides of the thighs with paprika, onion & garlic powder, thyme, salt and pepper.
2. Heat 1/3 of the butter in a large deep pan or pot over medium-high heat. Add the thighs and fry both sides until golden and cooked right through the centre. As the thighs cook, slice the mushrooms and finely dice the garlic.
3. Remove the thighs and keep warm in a bowl covered in foil. Add the mushrooms to the leftover fat and fry until golden. Push towards the outside of the pan, melt in 1 tbsp butter, then add the garlic. After about half a minute, stir in the orzo and stock.
4. Bring to a simmer and cook until the orzo is al dente and wrapped in a glossy sauce, stirring occasionally. Meanwhile, dice the parsley and chives, and grate the parmesan.
5. Once the orzo is cooked, stir in the parmesan, parsley, and the resting juices from the chicken. Finally, stir in the final tablespoon of butter. 
6. Serve with [[Chive Butter|chive butter]] and half a [[Lemon|lemon]] as optional garnish.
