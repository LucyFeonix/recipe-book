- 4 [[Egg|eggs]]

- 300ml [[Espresso|espresso]]
- *2 tbsp [[Marsala Wine|marsala wine]] or [[Rum|rum]]*
- *[[Cocoa Powder|cocoa powder]] for decoration*
# Notes
- 8 servings
- Requirements: 3 bowls, [[Casserole Dish|casserole dish]]
- Time: 30 min prep, 3 hours cooling
# Directions
1. To the freshly made espresso, add the marsala wine/rum.
> [!Warning] If making the tiramisu alcohol-free or generally for children, do not do this step.
2. Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Set aside the yolks, and whip the whites until they are stiff. The egg whites should not move when turning the bowl over.
3. In another bowl, add the egg yolks and the sugar, and beat until light and smooth.
4. In the meantime, pour the mascarpone cheese into a bowl and work it with a spoon to make it softer. When the yolks are ready, add the mascarpone.
5. Slowly whip the mascarpone cream for 2 to 3 minutes. Then, add the egg whites.
6. Using a wooden spoon, mix until smooth and creamy.
7. Dip the savoiardi into the coffee for about a second. Then arrange them in a casserole dish, covering the bottom. Spread the mascarpone over the savoiardi. Repeat until you run out of savoiardi or mascarpone.
> [!hint] It is important that the savoiardi does not soak up too much espresso. If they do, they will make the tiramisu much more runny, like a tiramisoup.
8. *Finally, sprinkle with cocoa powder for decoration. If wanted, [[Chocolate Chips|chocolate chips]] can also be added as decoration.*
9. Allow to stiffen in the fridge for 3 hours before serving - though, preferably, let it rest overnight.
