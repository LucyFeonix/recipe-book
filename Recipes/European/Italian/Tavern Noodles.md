# Directions
1. In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, warm 3 tbsp of olive oil until shimmering. Add the onions and some [[Salt|salt]], and caramelise the onions by cooking for 30 minutes and stirring frequently.
2. Add the rosemary/thyme and half of the garlic and cook until fragrant (±40 seconds). Add the wine, adjust the heat to medium-high, and cook until the liquid is reduced by half (±2 1/2 minutes)
3. While the onions are cooking, bring 4 quarts of water to a boil in a large pot. Add the salt and the pasta, and cook until just barely al dente, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking. Drain and return to pot, reserving a cup of cooking liquid.
4. Adjust the heat to medium-low, and add the onion mixture to the pasta. Toss and cook for ± 1 minute. 
5. Remove from heat, and add the remaining olive oil, garlic, parmesan, and salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]] to taste. Toss well.
> [!note] If the sauce is too thick, add some of the earlier-reserved cooking liquid to loosen it up.
6. Add (most of) the parsley and toss. Sprinkle with the chopped egg and remaining parsley for garnish before serving.
