# Directions
1. Prepare the rice according to package instructions. Thinly slice the garlic and ginger.
2. In a bowl, make a sauce of the garlic, soy sauce, ginger, water, rice vinegar, sweet chilli sauce, half of the corn starch, and sesame seeds.
3. Stir the egg into the rest of the corn starch in a different bowl, and add salt and [[Black Pepper|pepper]] to taste. Slice the chicken thighs into ±3cm pieces and dip these through the egg wash mixture.
4. Cut the broccoli. Add to a colander, and put this colander in a pan with low boiling water, making sure that the underside does not touch the water. Cover with a lid and steam for ±5 minutes.
> [!note] A steaming basket will also work.
5. Heat the oil in a wok and fry the egg-washed chicken in one layer in ±5 minutes on high. A sort of chicken ‘pancake’ will form, which will need to be turned about halfway. Lower the fire, and add the soy sauce mixture and stir in for two minutes. This will form a sticky sauce.
6. Cut the spring onion into thin rings, and add to the mixture. 
7. Serve hot.
