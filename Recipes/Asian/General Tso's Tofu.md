# Directions
1. Mix the honey and louisiana hot sauce in a bowl until combined. Add the tofu to the bowl, and toss together with a spatula until the tofu is well-coated.
2. Sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tofu, and tuss until evenly distributed. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the tofu until lightly coated.
3. Heat oil in a medium-sized frying pan until the oil is hot. 
4. Carefully place the tofu into the pan, ensuring that the pieces do not touch. Turn them over to continue frying on the other side. Continue until a nice crust is formed and they turn golden brown.
5. Heat your wok over medium heat, add 1 tbsp of the tofu-frying liquid. Add the ginger, the garlic, and the dried chilli peppers. Stir in the red bell peppers and the shaoxing wine.
6. Add the vegetable stock, and let the mixture come up to a boil. Add the broccoli.
7. Immediately add the soy sauces, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and sesame oil. Let come to a boil. Then, add the cornstarch mixture - depending on how thick you want your sauce, add more or less of this mixture.
