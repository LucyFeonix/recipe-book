# Directions
1. Take your soaked shiitake mushrooms, and squeeze out any excess water. Trim away any tough stems, thinly slice, and set aside.
2. In a small bowl, combine the hot water, light soy sauce, salt, MSG, sugar, and white pepper.
3. In a **separate** bowl, add the eggs, 1/2 tsp shaoxing wine, sesame oil, and a large pinch of salt. Combine.
4. Fluff your cooked rice.
5. Heat a wok and some oil over medium high heat. Add the seasoned eggs and scramble until they're just barely cooked. Remove from the wok, and set aside.
6. With the wok still over heat, heat more oil and add the red onions and the white parts of the scallions. Stir-fry for about a minute. Add the mushrooms, and stir-fry them for another half a minute.
7. Add a little bit more oil, followed by the sliced button and oyster mushrooms. Stir-fry for 1-2 minutes, until the fresh mushrooms are lightly browned and caramelised. Add the remaining shaoxing a rice. Immediately mix to evenly coat the rice.
10. Add the scrambled egg, and the green part of the scallions, and stir-fry for another 30 seconds.
11. Serve with [[Chilli Oil|chilli oil]], [[Chilli Flakes|chilli flakes]], or any other garnishing.
