2. Place a wok over high heat until almost smoking, then add the oil. Sear the beef until it's just barely browned. Transfer to a separate bowl, leaving any oil/fat in the wok.
3. Lower the heat to medium-high, and add the garlic and peppers. Stir-fry for a couple of seconds, then spread the shaoxing wine to deglaze.

> [!hint] If you like more sauce, add the chicken stock to further de-glaze the wok and let the liquid reduce slightly. The cornstarch from the marinade will help thicken the sauce.
