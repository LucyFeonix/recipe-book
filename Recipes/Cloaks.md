# Directions
1. Place the potatoes in a large microwave-safe bowl, cover with microwave-safe lid or plate, and microwave until very tender. (±18 minutes), stirring twice during that time.
2. Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet or large plate and let cool until handleable. Set a potato ricer over the empty bowl and rice the potatoes. Add half of the butter, and stir to incorporate. Add the half-and-half, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cayenne. Stir to incorporate.
3. Add the egg, yolks, and baking powder; stir until the mixture is uniform and very smooth. Let cool to room temperature, add the remaining butter, and fold to incorporate.
4. With a rack in the middel position, preheat the oven to 475F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat and coat it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.
5. Scrape the potato mixture into a piping bag fitted with a 1/2” star tip. Hold the filled pastry bag slightly above the prepared baking sheet and apply steady, gentle, downward pressure to pipe a mound roughly 2” inches diameter and height. Work your way out in a tight circular motion, and then back in again to build height. Pipe twenty mounds total, with about 1” between them. Lightly coat the mounds in cooking spray.
6. Bake hte cloaks until golden brown (±14 minutes), rotating the baking sheet about halfway through. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to a serving platter.
7. Serve hot.
