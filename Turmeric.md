*Turmeric* is a root of the [[Ginger|ginger]] family, native to the Indian subcontinent. As such, it is used a lot within the Indian kitchen. It is a spice with a bitter, peppery taste, and it is recognisable by its ochre-yellow tint. In powder form, it has a warm, bitter flavour not unlike [[Black Pepper|black pepper]], and an earthy, [[Mustard|mustard]]-like aroma.
It is a tasty food-safe dye, as exemplified in eastern curries, and by its approval as E100 in the European Union.

Along with the Indian kitchen, the root is widely used as a spice in South Asian and Middle Eastern cooking, such as in [[Ras el Hanout]], or in South African [[Bobotie|bobotie]] rice. It is also used to make [[Golden Latte|golden lattes]].


> [!warning] Turmeric will also dye you and your clothing, if you do not use it carefully.
